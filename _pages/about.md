You may know me as the long-haired guy who frequents the chai places around IIT Gandhinagar. Or, you may know me as ```plugyawn```, which is what I identify as online. Either way, this is my slice of the internet, so here's a little bit about me.

I'm intrigued by Theoretical Deep Learning, Probabilistic Machine Learning and Differential Equations (especially in Operator Learning). My research is aligned along those fields. 

I've been part of the Google Summer of Code, I am a Cargill Global Scholar, and I'm also serving as the Overall Technical Secretary at IIT Gandhinagar, overseeing all technical activities that occur here at the student level. I also spent a wonderful summer in sunny California as a Caltech SURF fellow in the summer of 2023. 

As a sidequest, I've also led a team of 120 students for a year and brought my institute's cultural fest back offline in 2021.

If you see me at IIT Gandhinagar, do say hi -- first chai's on me.
